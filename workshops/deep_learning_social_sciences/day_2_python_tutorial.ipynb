    "Today, we will demonstrate how deep learning methods can be used to fit and extend traditional latent variable models used in [structural equation modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_equation_modeling) and [item response theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Item_response_theory).\n",
    "\n",
    "The methods used here come primarily from two papers. The first paper is by [van Kesteren and Oberski (2022)](#refs) and demonstrates how to fit structural equation models using backpropagation and stochastic gradient-based optimization. The second paper is by [Urban and Bauer (2021)](#refs) and demonstrates how to fit item response theory models using deep learning-based approximate inference methods. Both papers have Python packages that make using the methods convenient: these are called [tensorsem](https://github.com/vankesteren/tensorsem) and [DeepIRTools](https://github.com/cjurban/deepirtools), respectively. If you have not already installed these packages, you can do so now using:"
