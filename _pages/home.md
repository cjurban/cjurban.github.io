Hi, I'm Christopher!

I'm an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://web.uri.edu/psychology/">Department of Psychology</a> at the <a href="https://www.uri.edu/">University of Rhode Island</a>.

I obtained my Ph.D. in <a href="https://quantpsych.unc.edu/">Quantitative Psychology</a> at the <a href="https://www.unc.edu/">University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</a>, where I was advised by <a href="https://dbauer.web.unc.edu/">Dan Bauer</a>.

<strong>My research goal is to develop quantitative methods to help understand, predict, and influence human behaviors</strong>. I am currently focused on combining <a href="https://www.psychometricsociety.org/what-psychometrics">psychometrics</a> with <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14539">deep learning</a> to build probabilistic models for analyzing complex behavioral data such as smartphone and wearable sensor data, social media usage data, and electronic health records.
